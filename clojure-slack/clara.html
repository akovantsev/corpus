This is significantly more challenging. I had an experimental extension of Clara where the memory was distributed across a Storm cluster, but this effort was dropped due to other needs. The big challenge is fault tolerance of a distributed working memory. If a node becomes unavailable, how do we recover its part of the Rete network?

We have a similar requirement when we want to fire rule-3, when either rule-1 or rule-2 does not fire for a fact of TypeA

We find that the [:not [Logicamarker ]] approach is not working as it appears that RETE engine fires the rule bcos before the rule-1 or rule-2 creates the LogicalMarker, rule-3 LHS seems to be satisfied.

Any tips would be really helpful.

The contract from Clara is that the state after all rules finish firing will be consistent with the rules, but the steps Clara takes to get there inside fire-rules are undefined except if you provide salience. Your print statements are reflecting intermediate state in the rules engine that is eliminated before fire-rules returns. So in your first example, collect-invalids fired with no Invalid facts because none had been created yet; once Invalid facts were created it fired with them. If collect-invalids had inserted other fact(s) the facts inserted by the firing with no Invalid facts yet would be removed before fire-rules returned to the caller. For something like this I’d suggest using queries or inserting another fact using insert! since these will be adjusted by the truth maintenance system when Invalid facts are added to the session."><y>#</y><d>2016-11-17</d><h>09:31</h><w>wparker</w><a>@surreal.analysis</a> I think this is expected behavior.

It is also possible to add arbitrary listeners to a session - you can see the protocol at https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clara/rules/listener.cljc and an example that simply records all operations listened upon at https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clara/tools/tracing.clj - but keep in mind that listeners often take you into internal implementation details that could change. Also Clara sessions are immutable, in keeping with typical Clojure data structure semantics.

I was struggling because for this specific problem coming up it was not clear how to create facts that are [:not [B (= ?id id)]] [:attrs {:href &quot;/_/_/users/U0ZS009CN&quot;}] sorry for long delay, just saw your response. I’m not sure what you mean to create a fact to match a negation (ie condition with a :not ). The negation condition is used in conjuction with the [A (= ?id id)] in my example. This together forms a “join” sort of query for all A that do not have a matching B . So back to that example, repeating for clarity: (r/defrule joins [A (= ?id id)] [B (= ?id id)] =&gt; (r/insert!

So I think the loop goes like this (only including relevant fields):

1) insert <code>Field{:field-key :site :read-only true}</code>

2) activate <code>rule1</code>

3) fire <code>rule1</code>
- insert <code>FieldState{:field-key :site :read-only true}</code>

4) activate <code>rule2</code>

5) fire <code>rule2</code>
- insert <code>Operation{:field-key :site}</code>

6) retract previous <code>rule1</code> results since <code>(acc/all)</code> changed
7) retract previous <code>rule2</code> results since <code>rule1</code> retracted the matching fact changed ;; due to (6)
8) retract previous <code>rule1</code> results since <code>(acc/all)</code> changed ;; due to (7) - no actual retraction needed here, just updates the accumulator again (6) already retracted

9) (re-)activate <code>rule1</code> ;; due to (8)

10) insert <code>Field{:field-key :site :read-only true}</code> ;; no Op1 anymore

11) repeat (4) and (5)
12) repeat (6) (7) ( 8 ) (9)

13) keep repeating (11) (12)</z><z id="t1505347570" t="Oliver George Ah! right. That makes sense. Thank you."><y>#</y><d>2017-09-14</d><h>00:06</h><w>Oliver George</w>Ah! right.  That makes sense.

I personally think of Clojure’s compiler as a “procedural” one that takes in code and alters the state of the runtime environment accordingly.</z><z id="t1505408503" t="dadair I have a shared namespace for shared records, then I build sessions like so: (r/mk-session &apos;rules.shared &apos;rules.x &apos;rules.y)"><y>#</y><d>2017-09-14</d><h>17:01</h><w>dadair</w>I have a shared namespace for shared records, then I build sessions like so: <code>(r/mk-session &apos;rules.shared &apos;rules.x &apos;rules.y)</code></z><z id="t1505408541" t="dadair you need to make sure you are requiring the namespace too before making the session, I&apos;ve run into that before"><y>#</y><d>2017-09-14</d><h>17:02</h><w>dadair</w>you need to make sure you are requiring the namespace too before making the session, I&apos;ve run into that before</z><z id="t1505408581" t="dadair so either put rules.shared into the (ns ..

Filters that can be expressed as values of bindings can end up being expressed as just map gets if the query parameters are set appropriately.

Basically since the :or operation is actually more of a union in the set theory sense, I think the to-dnf transforms can end up messing with cardinality. For example, [:not [:and A B]] is equivalent to [:or [:not A] [:not B]] in a boolean sense, but the second can match twice and the first can’t in the context of Clara."><y>#</y><d>2018-01-08</d><h>15:51</h><w>wparker</w><a>@mikerod</a> I haven’t gotten around to doing a comprehensive writeup, but basically I was looking at how to address <a href="https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/343" target="_blank">https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules/issues/343</a> and ran into what I think are some issues with to-dnf.

Precept uses :a with a Tuple record [e a v t] (t is an incremented fact id). We use the clojure’s (derive) to associate cardinality and uniqueness with :a keywords. Clara receives the hierarchy via the :ancestors-fn option in order to be able to match on :all attributes. Every :a descends from :all so you can write conditions that will obtain across attributes (e.g. [?e :all 42]). The ancestry is also used outside Clara for maintaining e-a-v and a-v-e indexes. When facts are inserted or retracted it lets us determine their cardinality and uniqueness constraints. Based on that and the current indexes we determine whether inserts and retracts should be performed so that the schema can be adhered to, or whether an error should be thrown. Over the weekend I worked on a design that doesn’t use global vars for the indexes and ancestors hierarchy. I haven’t figured it out yet. insert! seems like the real challenge. It’s not part of the ISession protocol and only takes facts as arguments. My best guess is that we should bind a session’s indexes and ancestry to a dynamic var (like session-context) when fire rules is called on it. Then we could read from it from within an insert! implementation and update the indexes there. I think that’d require something like a LocalDatalogSession that could take these extra arguments in its constructor."><y>#</y><d>2018-06-04</d><h>14:45</h><w>alex-dixon</w><a>@mikerod</a>

Precept uses <code>:a</code> with a Tuple record [e a v t] (t is an incremented fact id). We use the clojure’s (derive) to associate cardinality and uniqueness with <code>:a</code> keywords. Clara receives the hierarchy via the :ancestors-fn option in order to be able to match on <code>:all</code> attributes. Every <code>:a</code> descends from <code>:all</code> so you can write conditions that will obtain across attributes (e.g. [?e :all 42]). 

The ancestry is also used outside Clara for maintaining e-a-v and a-v-e indexes. When facts are inserted or retracted it lets us determine their cardinality and uniqueness constraints. Based on that and the current indexes we determine whether inserts and retracts should be performed so that the schema can be adhered to, or whether an error should be thrown.

Somehow, this becomes the input to phase 2, which fires a new set of rules, generating new facts. Etc. I’m not sure what the best way is to pass the output of one phase into the next. Originally I was thinking I’d just take the session from phase 1 and use that as the starting point for phase 2.

Somehow, this becomes the input to phase 2, which fires a new set of rules, generating new facts. Etc.

I’m not sure what the best way is to pass the output of one phase into the next. Originally I was thinking I’d just take the session from phase 1 and use that as the starting point for phase 2. But unless I’m missing something, it’s not possible to load new rules into an extant session.

The left activate in that snippet seems to be aimed at rules that have no LHS, ex:
<pre>(r/defrule insert-sentinel

the token being passed is empty. This &quot;bootstrapping&quot; operation is likely done because these productions wouldn&apos;t have an alpha-root for them to be triggered later.

In your scenario:

the first node in the beta-roots would be the test-node, as mentioned before this is not a normal pattern as test nodes are usually dependent on prior facts.

(in the google-group the title is Infinite Loop when using :not-guard in a rule)

I tried to do something that is really easy to do in e.g. Datalog, like having given a node-&gt;parent relationship, I try to get hold of all the parents that are around (no duplicates). This snippet show the data-model with the rule:

<pre>(defrecord Node2Parent [node parent])
(defrecord Node [node])
(r/defrule insert-all-parents
  [Node2Parent (= ?parent parent)]
  [:not [Node (= node ?parent)]]
  =&gt;
  (r/insert! (-&gt;Node ?parent))
  )</pre>

The way I read this is that we add a new <code>Node</code>-fact for each occurring parent, that has not been added already.

And here&apos;s how I call it:
<pre>(defn s [] (-&gt; (r/mk-session &apos;engine.core) (r/insert (-&gt;Node2Parent :inner1 :root)
                                                     (-&gt;Node2Parent :leaf1 :root)
                                                 (-&gt;Node2Parent :leaf2 :inner1)
                                                 (-&gt;Node2Parent :leaf3 :inner1))
           (r/fire-rules)))

(r/defquery all-nodes &quot;all nodes&quot;
  []
  [Node (= ?node node)])
(r/query (s) all-nodes)</pre>

It goes into a infinite loop and never comes back. Adding a print-statement to the rule tell you that it keeps adding :root nodes to the fact-base.
I guess that I miss something the way the unification in the LHS-conditions play out.

To resolve components that are productive I create facts of dependencies and mark components that are used by productive components as productive as well.
Right when I have a loop in the dependency chain, clara rules ends up in a endless loop while firing rules.
Here is the code:
<pre>(ns clara.error
  (:require [clara.rules :refer :all]))

(defrecord DependsOn [element dep])
(defrecord Productive [element])

(defrule productive
  &quot;&quot;
  [DependsOn (= ?element1 element) (= ?element2 dep)]
  [Productive (= ?element1 element)]
  =&gt;
  (insert! (-&gt;Productive ?element2)))

; Works
(as-&gt; (mk-session &apos;clara.error) $
      (apply insert $ [(-&gt;Productive &quot;A&quot;)])
      (apply insert $ [(-&gt;DependsOn &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot;)

The approach of clara rules is awesome. That&apos;s why I hope we can find the problem so I can continue using clara rules.

FWIW, I&apos;m looking into something that might work better than Drools for us. On that side we currently leverage rule-groups, and the order of groups is controlled.

Also Clara is aligning its default DSL syntax closer to the world of forward chaining rules engines that have existed for a long time. </z><z id="t1561997834" t="mikerod But your problem seems interesting [:attrs {:href &quot;/_/_/users/U051HUZLD&quot;}] I don’t have necessarily any easy answers there.

Im evaluating potentially using Clara for one of our use cases. Can you imagine a sensible way to be able to determine the start-time and end-time of a given rule execution? Say I have a rule that has some expensive operation… I’d like to be able to record when it started and ended, ideally without adding the required code to the rule itself and adding the values to the emitted fact (as it would be great if all rules exposed this information implicitly). I’ve started looked into: • The inspect + trace tools dont seem to provide it • Creating a new Listener, but this may be a bad idea given it would no longer be immutable if its calling out for the current time? • Creating a macro and extend the parsing logic to wrap the rule execution somehow Any thoughts / suggestions appreciated.

I have been trying to write a rule for a board game, but I haven&apos;t been able to do it. The rule in English is: During a player&apos;s turn, at the stage of the turn called :into-city, the player will move into the city if either there are no other players in the city, or if there is just one player in the city and the total number of players is more than four. I have these fact types: (defrecord Player [id name health score energy]) (defrecord Turn [id stage]) (defrecord InCity [id]) InCity just means that a player is in the city.

I have been trying to write a rule
for a board game, but I haven&apos;t been able to do it. The rule
in English is:

During a player&apos;s turn, at the stage of the turn called
:into-city, the player will move into the city if either
there are no other players in the city, or if there is just
one player in the city and the total number of players is
more than four.

I have these fact types:

<pre>(defrecord Player [id name health score energy])
(defrecord Turn [id stage])
(defrecord InCity [id])</pre>
InCity just means that a player is in the city. Turn keeps
track of whose turn it is and at what stage the player is in
his turn. Player just represents a player.

I tried this:

<pre>(cr/defrule into-city
  [?turn &lt;- Turn (= ?id id) (= :into-city stage)]
  [?players &lt;- (acc/count) :from [Player]]
  [?in-city &lt;- (acc/count) :from [InCity]]
  ;; (or (zero? ?in-city
  ;;            (and (= 1 ?in-city)
  ;;                 (&gt; ?players 4))))
  =&gt;
  (cr/retract! ?turn)
  (cr/insert! (-&gt;Turn ?id (next-stage :into-city)))
  (cr/insert! (-&gt;InCity ?id)))</pre>
But of course that part of the condition with &quot;if either
there are no other players in the city, or if there is just
one player in the city and the total number of players is
more than 4&quot; is missing. I have commented out an expression
that I tried to put in there somehow. But I&apos;m not sure where
to put that. As far as I have seen, conditions apply to
individual facts, and I&apos;m not sure if I can put in another
condition line with just boolean logic. Can I?

Also, since, as you can see, I&apos;m retracting the Turn fact
that led to the new facts being inserted, because now the
stage of the turn is the next stage, and so the inserted
facts will be instantly retracted, right? So how should I
think about it? I&apos;m finding it harder than I anticipated to
write a program with rules.</z><z id="t1588526338" t="ethanc To: &gt; As far as I have seen, conditions apply to &gt; individual facts, and I&apos;m not sure if I can put in another &gt; condition line with just boolean logic.

You could write a query that would match all facts e.g. against Object on the JVM, but the performance impact of that could be significant. You might consider whether you actually need multiple sessions though - what is the motivation there as opposed to having the facts you’re extracting trigger those rules in the same session? You could use a design pattern where you have subsets of your system that have “private” facts that by convention are only used in say a particular namespace, and “glue” facts that connect different parts.

The rule will only execute and be considered true if the fact in question is not within the session. However, if the rule inserts a fact that itself asserts to be absent, then a loop would be formed. A base state would be a session without the fact in question, ergo the rule must insert the Fact. Then clara must assert that all truth has been maintained, and finds that the Fact is now present. Meaning that the Rule is no no longer true, thus a logical retraction occurs removing the Fact from the session. Then clara must asser that all truth has been maintained, again.

 <a href="http://www.clara-rules.org/docs/truthmaint/" target="_blank">http://www.clara-rules.org/docs/truthmaint/</a>

With the <code>not</code> un-commented, the rule itself becomes a logical contradiction of itself. The rule will only execute and  be considered true if the fact in question is not within the session. However, if the rule inserts a fact that itself asserts to be absent, then a loop would be formed.

A base state would be a session without the fact in question, ergo the rule must insert the Fact. Then clara must assert that all truth has been maintained, and finds that the Fact is now present. Meaning that the Rule is no no longer true, thus a logical retraction occurs removing the Fact from the session. Then clara must asser that all truth has been maintained, again. However we are back to the base state meaning that there is no Fact within the session and the Rule is true again, thus the cycle repeats and continues forever.

Either way, clara doesn’t seem to expect to re-bind vars with joins in this manner.</z><z id="t1617909137" t="ethanc I have also logged an issue to the http://www.clara-rules.org/ site to add documentation on the nature of destructuring in the LHS: https://github.com/cerner/clara-site/issues/39"><y>#</y><d>2021-04-08</d><h>19:12</h><w>ethanc</w>I have also logged an issue to the <a href="http://www.clara-rules.org/" target="_blank">http://www.clara-rules.org/</a> site to add documentation on the nature of destructuring in the LHS:

It’s optional, but when you abandon it you introduce order-of-evaluation-dependencies within the rules. It can be easy to get in inconsistence states when managing it all unconditionally. Typically, ideally, you’d be able to run the rules with full truth maintenance as somewhat of a “pure fn”. You’d then use a query on some derived facts to drive external processes and side effects.

From the rules engine side of things its pretty easy to say what facts match certain criteria, but the inverse is significantly more tough, as it generally requires an understanding of the constraints of the rules themselves. Typically for use-cases like this, i believe the common practice is to have a “tiered” set of rules to explain what caused a fact not to match. ex: (r/defrule expected-rule [?a &lt;- A (&gt; x 12)] =&gt; (r/insert! (-&gt;B ?a))) (r/defrule missing-fact [:not [B]] [?a &lt;- A] =&gt; (r/insert!

&gt; It almost feels like it suffers from the same problem above
yes, it does suffer from a similar issue. From the rules engine side of things its pretty easy to say what facts match certain criteria, but the inverse is significantly more tough, as it generally requires an understanding of the constraints of the rules themselves.

I am observing different behavior depending on whether the RHS uses <code>insert-alll!</code>  or <code>insert-all-unconditional!</code>. A rule with a LHS of <code>[A] [:not [B]]</code> and with a RHS that inserts <code>B</code> works as expected if I use <code>insert-all-unconditonal!</code>, but it loops continuously evaluating the rule over and over if I use <code>insert-all!</code>. It is as if the evaluation loop does not find <code>B</code> in the working memory if it has been inserted logically when evaluating <code>[:not [B]]</code>.

Is this expected?</z><z id="t1632455644" t="ethanc Yes, in clara we have the idea of truth maintenance: http://www.clara-rules.org/docs/truthmaint/ Clara re-evaluates the state of the session, inserting and retracting facts that logically should or shouldn&apos;t exist until a steady state exists, ie. no new facts are inserted or retracted. insert-all! abides by truth maintenance, where as insert-all-unconditional! does not.

<a href="http://www.clara-rules.org/docs/truthmaint/" target="_blank">http://www.clara-rules.org/docs/truthmaint/</a>

Clara  re-evaluates the state of the session, inserting and retracting facts that logically should or shouldn&apos;t exist until a steady state exists, ie. no new facts are inserted or retracted. <code>insert-all!</code> abides by truth maintenance, where as <code>insert-all-unconditional!</code> does not. Meaning that a rule that is logically cyclical, and using <code>insert-all!</code> would loop forever, as opposed to stopping evaluation.

The State of the session would likely be as follows:

 Begin Loop 1: Nothing
Step1.1: No Widget found, unconditionally insert default widget (adds activation to queue)
End Loop 1

Begin Loop 2: Fire pending activations (first “adding widget”)
Step 1.2: Flush default widget
Step 2.2: A default widget is available and matches the condition on “set-widget-attrs”, insert custom widget, retract default widget (adds activation to queue)
End Loop 2

Begin Loop 3: Fire pending activations (first “setting material”), Insert Custom Widget1 (added to pending updates), Retract Default widget (retracted immediately)
Step1.3: Retraction removes the default widget from the session, triggering rule ‘add-widget’ to add an activation as there are technically no other Widgets in the session (only pending)
Step2.3: Custom widget1 inserted and flushed
End Loop 3

Begin Loop 4: Fire activation (second “adding widget”)
Step 1.4: Flush default widget
Step 2.4: A default widget is available and matches the condition on “set-widget-attrs”, insert custom widget(2), retract default widget (adds activation to queue)
End Loop 4

Begin Loop 5: Fire pending activations (second “setting material”), Insert Custom Widget2 (added to pending updates), Retract Default widget (retracted immediately)
Step1.5: Retraction removes the default widget from the session, triggering rule ‘add-widget’ however due to Custom widget 1 being in the session, no activation is added
Step2.5: Custom widget2 inserted and flushed
End Loop 5

Example:
<pre>(defrule a-rule

Due to the implementation of clara, “In most cases, those not being joined to other facts”, most constraints are simply “plopped” into an <code>if</code> block.
So, in short… i guess i would recommend ordering constraints similar to how you would if you are writing an explicit <code>if</code> yourself…
That being, if you know one check is “cheaper” put it first in an attempt to short circuit the following logic.

Thanks Linus and Mike. I had found the clara-eav project which seems like it might be useful. During my research I’d come across eql so seems like pathom is also worth investigating too. I’m also considering the datalog dbs like datalevin and xtdb but I think we’d find value in the truth-maintenance feature (sometimes events will be cancelled). Maybe we can use clara to derive the novel info and a db to persist facts between invocations. The request caching in pathom seems like it would be useful especially if I can use it in conjunction with clara (some of our inferences take a while to compute/fetch, others are immediate)."><y>#</y><d>2022-12-14</d><h>13:32</h><r>cddr</r>Cool.
