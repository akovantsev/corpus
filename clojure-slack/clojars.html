The repo is your only real source of truth, packages and even compilers can be hacked. 2. That means that the only way to really validate code is to a. trust a developer (and the access control on the repo) and b. content address the code to make sure your getting what the trusted dev was intending. 3. Ideally at the repo level trust is established socially via real world interactions which could also be related to online activity like github data (this is kinda what we already do, for better or worse) 4. In order to validate the packages content, you cannot receive the verification data and the package from the same source, this is a basic single point of failure in any architecture. It’s not that I don’t trust clojars, it’s that it makes them a single point of failure and also means they are the ones telling me what my trusted developers packages are. 5. Whats needed is a way to verify from the developer what the data should be (or from the repo directly) or any other distributed trust, and then verify that against the packages, in transit security is “good enough” already if you are using certificates 6. none of this takes into account the versioning or human readable layer to all this, versions would basically be sugar on top of all the verification, since it’s still needed in a package manager."><y>#</y><d>2016-09-12</d><h>19:08</h><w>flyboarder</w>A few thoughts RE: Security:

Hi Daniel and Alex, Christian Stein explained that Travis CI will always provide an unpatched JDK installation.

I have fixed the builds in my project. It involved manually symlinking the system CA certs in the <code>before_install</code> stage.
You can find this minimal Travis CI configurations as an example.

I think there was a failure to upload the sum files from the server -&gt; s3, but I wasn&apos;t checking the results of the call, so the code would have considered it always successful. I&apos;ve modified the s3 client to throw on error so we can see if that happens again • 400 Bad Request responses when trying to deploy - I was able to find 400 responses in Fastly logs, and they were all for maven-metadata.xml files. I suspect this might be related to some custom Fastly configuration we had to set short cache TTLs for the metadata files (and sums). I&apos;ve removed that configuration and now instead make purge requests against Fastly&apos;s API for maven-metadata.xml files (and their checksum files) when a deploy occurs. This is a better approach anyway, since it would make the new metadata files available pretty much immediately instead of having to wait for the 60 second TTL to expire and allows us to cache metadata files that don&apos;t change for much longer, which is a cost savings.

A summary of what I&apos;ve found so far, based on log files from 2020-02-20 and 2020-02-21:

• The 400s are being returned by the Fastly CDN
• It is only on a few GET requests for <code>maven-metadata.xml</code> files (both existing (which should return a 200) and non-existing (which should return a 404)). No other paths are affected.
• Only six client IPs were affected out of 8,122 that made <code>GET /.../maven-metadata.xml</code> requests
• Only 266 requests were affected out of 107,255 for <code>GET /.../maven-metadata.xml</code>

• There is no common client, OS version, or Java version based on the user-agent strings
• There is no common cache host
• I have not been able to recreate it
Actions taken to remediate:
• There was custom configuration in Fastly to override the cache TTL for <code>maven-metadata.xml</code> files. This is the only configuration that would treat those files differently. It was obviated by <a href="https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/6c081e809a4c2e0c4ddf5359c2fc858d1cd5dc2b" target="_blank">https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/6c081e809a4c2e0c4ddf5359c2fc858d1cd5dc2b</a> and removed ~ 2020-02-21 01:00 UTC  
• This didn&apos;t resolve the issue immediately, but it&apos;s possible the 400s were cached
• ~2020-02-22 16:30 UTC all 54 paths that had 400s in the logs were purged from Fastly&apos;s cache
• It is unknown if this will help with the issue
I&apos;ve captured this in <a href="https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/issues/744" target="_blank">https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/issues/744</a> as well.

We would just need to add some logic there, then deny deploys to those groups until someone that is group owner (or the group creator, if a push will create the group) logs in via GitHub with that username • other reverse-hostname groups - We could validate these automatically with a TXT record. I think initially I would prefer doing so manually with folks filing GH issues, since that would let us see what validation methods work for folks, and wouldn&apos;t require as much upfront implementation (so could be released sooner - my availability to work on Clojars is essentially a small amount of time on the weekends ATM) • That leaves non-reverse-hostname groups - these are (generally) less likely to shadow internal artifacts, especially when the group and artifact name are the same (`cheshire/cheshire` , hiccup/hiccup , etc). These require a bit of thought on how to validate. We could: ◦ Allow deployment to continue to existing ones, but don&apos;t allow new ones to be created, pushing folks to use reverse-hostname groups ◦ Allow them to be created unvalidated. This isn&apos;t a great option, since it would still allow potential shadowing, and would push more folks to using these types of groups since reverse-hostname groups now require validation, and it would be good for us to go the other way as a community. An open question is do we disallow all deploys to an unvalidated group? Or just forbid creation of new artifacts until validation? Or just disallow new group creation until validation? Another easier (implementation-wise) but more painful (for the community) option is to make clojars read-only, and have folks switch to deploying to OSSRH. That would require lots more work from library maintainers, and would change the names of almost everything, so probably isn&apos;t a great option. But it would move us to a more vetted/trusted model, and would take some of the burden of maintaining our own package system off of me/the community. That&apos;s my $0.02 currently.

1. Can I write a macro that generates malicious code on the fly? If so, does it pass Veracode scan .

Yes, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible to prevent detect that in the general case. This is probably not a different situation than many other languages though. 2. It&apos;s probably quite difficult to replace an existing jar. I think the real scenario here is whether you could release a new version of an existing jar and have users include that artifact without knowing it had malicious code. If the actual owner did this, probably very possible - many consumers automatically bump version deps. That&apos;s really on you as a consumer and the amount of diligence you have around deps (in general, I think we should have much higher awareness than we do now). A malicious user would require authentication access to be able to deploy a new jar version (what this is depends on the repository as its a decentralized system), so you&apos;re back to &quot;how secure are your passwords&quot;/2FA kind of questions. http is by default not allowed, and there have been other changes in Maven recently to reduce the possibility of MITM."><y>#</y><d>2022-03-07</d><h>22:15</h><r>Alex Miller (Clojure team)</r>1.

These exact matches are weighted heavily so that they appear first in the results. This seems to be working well enough."><y>#</y><d>2022-04-17</d><h>23:09</h><r>lread</r>Other tidbit that might interest you:

My understanding is that clojars will verify signatures if the jars are signed; but does tools.deps/leiningen verify signatures on the fetching side? My feeling is that they don’t, and that the typical state of jar signing is that some are some aren’t, and that until almost all are signed, that policy can’t tightened. Also for signed jars, how are the public keys obtained to verify? I’m guessing through php keyservers, and then you have the problem of verifying keychains etc which likely doesn’t bottom out at a trustable authority (unless we’re to trust key-signing parties etc, which would probably be hard to automate). So is it the case that this isn’t really worth doing? My feeling is that since clojars etc are now https the risk is minimised; so the main vector is just a malicious party hacking jar on clojars and replacing your jar with something else. Is the above a fair assessment of the current status of this? If so it seems like signing jars in CI probably isn’t worth the hassle at the minute??"><y>#</y><d>2023-02-02</d><h>11:45</h><w>rickmoynihan</w>What is the current status of jar signing in clojars and the clojure community?
