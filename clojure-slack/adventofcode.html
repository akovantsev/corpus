At small values of dy (i.e. close to the minimum bounding box), dB is larger than dC (meaning C has points on the box edge.

If you take a point and a line going through it. All the areas defined by the perpendicular bisectors with the points on one side will create areas that are infinite on the other side of this line. So if you want to close the area that includes this point you will need at least one point on the other side of this line. Now if you take a point on the bounding box and the side of the bounding box as the line, by definition the points on the bounding box have only points on one side of this line so they will all belong to areas that are infinite outside of the bounding box.

Currently I hold onto way too many old layers, because I keep track of my unit-size squares and <code>floor(size/2)</code> squares on up, hence my memory management problem.

Here are my questions and notes if you ever get a little time: 1) mapv : I didn&apos;t realize map was creating a lazy seq because my repl always gives me the result immediately. At a meta level is that something I should be thinking about more? Like, when could that be an issue, is there a time when I will have an error because map hasn&apos;t &quot;realized&quot; it&apos;s seq? 2) I used Integer. instead of Parselong I have mixed feelings on having so many different paths to the same result. Which is better for which scenario and is that just something gained with experience or is there a good best practices guide? 3) If I had known about reduced and reductions I think I may have solved it! I was pounding my head trying to figure out how to get each step of the reduce and have that be my freq (what you called acc ). Good stuff! 4) I like your whole recursion v reductions v seq abstractions approach to idiomatic clojure. That being said, I love your part-2-reduce+seq the most. That one seems so clear and what I was trying to do in my head. The transducer stuff was over my head. I admit I was chuckling when you were doing the duplicates function and kept mentioning &quot;don&apos;t worry about understanding the logic here, but you just need to flip this expression with this one.&quot; How can you do that without understanding the logic?! lol! 5) Just a couple general tooling things I observed that I was curious about: When you put in str/split-lines it looks like Cursive included the dependency automatically in your ns declaration. True? I wonder if Cider can do that. Since I only used split-lines once I just used the full ns version. I was going to ask your philosophy on that but I imagine that&apos;s partly dictated by it being done for you easily. Your bottom right frame. It seems to be acting like a scratch buffer connected to the same repl. Or is that just how Cursive&apos;s repl looks? Sorry for the book.

1. <code>def</code> should go outside your <code>defn</code>. Use <code>let</code> inside your functions.
2. <code>for</code> can be combined into one. This way you can avoid <code>flatten</code>
3. <code>(nth seq 0)</code> equals <code>first</code>
4. I think in this task <code>subvec</code> is not necessary.

e.g.,

From the example:

<pre>(count-paths [1 4 5 6 7 10 11 12 15 16 19])
;; =&gt; 8</pre>
and when cutting on a three jump (from 7 to 10) you can just multiply solutions to both parts:

<pre>(* (count-paths [1 4 5 6 7])
   (count-paths [10 11 12 15 16 19]))

But when cutting between 10 and 11, you miss a few solutions:

<pre>(* (count-paths [1 4 5 6 7 10])
   (count-paths [11 12 15 16 19]))

Find partitions where smallest number in partition is within 3 of biggest. either the partition will have 4 numbers in it, or the partition will have 3 numbers in it (or less)

Partitions with 4 will have 4 combos.
Partitions with 3 will have 2 combos.

Multiply all theses partitions combo counts together.
