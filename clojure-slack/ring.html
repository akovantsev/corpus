I want to make this endpoint compatible with partial file loading, but I can&apos;t find any information about it on the web, aside from (<a href="https://github.com/remvee/ring-partial-content" target="_blank">https://github.com/remvee/ring-partial-content</a>).  (It seems to work only with <code>wrap-file</code>, and I don&apos;t think that fits my usecase, but I may be wrong).

Does that analysis seem correct, or flawed?</z><z id="t1506621995" t="seancorfield The addresses go from left to right, client to server."><y>#</y><d>2017-09-28</d><h>18:06</h><w>seancorfield</w>The addresses go from left to right, client to server.</z><z id="t1506622043" t="seancorfield The same client IP could go through different proxies at different times to get to you -- so you&apos;d get a different set of IPs for the same client (user)."><y>#</y><d>2017-09-28</d><h>18:07</h><w>seancorfield</w>The same client IP could go through different proxies at different times to get to you -- so you&apos;d get a different set of IPs for the same client (user).</z><z id="t1506622101" t="seancorfield That said, some ISPs don&apos;t expose the actual client IP at all and only give you an IP for an edge proxy (AOL is a good example -- or was... can&apos;t remember if it still does)."><y>#</y><d>2017-09-28</d><h>18:08</h><w>seancorfield</w>That said, some ISPs don&apos;t expose the actual client IP at all and only give you an IP for an edge proxy (AOL is a good example -- or was... can&apos;t remember if it still does).</z><z id="t1507023553" t="mpenet evaluating routing libs for a project. so much choice now... a lot of good stuff out there"><y>#</y><d>2017-10-03</d><h>09:39</h><w>mpenet</w>evaluating routing libs for a project. so much choice now... a lot of good stuff out there</z><z id="t1507023675" t="mpenet feel free to suggest good options/experiences"><y>#</y><d>2017-10-03</d><h>09:41</h><w>mpenet</w>feel free to suggest good options/experiences</z><z id="t1507040378" t="ikitommi [:attrs {:href &quot;/_/_/users/U050SC7SV&quot;}] just cooking up metosin/reitit as was not happy with any of the existing ones.

                .setIssuer(&quot;&quot;)
                .setAudience(&quot;&quot;)                // defaults to &apos;&apos;
                .setConnectionTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(1)) // defaults to 1s
                .setReadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(1))       // defaults to 1s
                .build();
        try {
            Jwt jwt = jwtVerifier.decode(&quot;jwt-token-here&quot;);
            System.out.print(jwt.getClaims().get(&quot;upn&quot;));
        } catch (JwtVerificationException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

I am using <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/ring-oauth2" target="_blank">https://github.com/weavejester/ring-oauth2</a> to use corporate IDP.
My application is SPA served on <code>/webpage</code>. And launch_uri (initializes auth) is on <code>/login/</code>.
My redirect URI is <code>/login/callback</code>. I do not know what should be set in this route so there is nothing right now. Do I have to have some logic there?

When I recieve the code from IDP I am redirected to <code>/login/callback</code> where I recieve <code>state mismatch</code> error.  But I can see that <code>state</code>  query string parameter is same as the first time I call IDP.

Can somebody point me to the right direction as I am hopeless right now?

I have 2 apps, both with jetty/ring-adapter 1.8.1, muuntaja 0.6.7 for transit.
I’d like to stream it all the way to the  browser.

the  browser calls app A, which calls app B using clj-http 3.10.1 and with the following options
<pre>(defn as-stream [params]
  (-&gt; params
      (assoc :as :stream :decompress-body false)
      (update :headers assoc :accept-encoding &quot;gzip&quot;)))</pre>
to avoid unziping and rezipping the response.

App B  pulls a large dataset from the db. I just enabled streaming in muuntaja with <code>:return :output-stream</code>
When i call app B directly via curl, i get the response within a reasonable time.
When i call app A, the streaming happens very very slowly, with multi second pauses.

E.g. we use Selmer so we pass this as a html template param: :csrf-token *anti-forgery-token* This is used by javascript functions like this: &lt;script&gt; (() =&gt; { abc.init({ ... csrfToken: &apos;{{csrf-token}}&apos; }); and we also use the convenient anti-forgery-field function and add the csrf token automatically to all html templates (selmer.parser/add-tag! :csrf-field (fn [_ _] (anti-forgery-field))) "><y>#</y><d>2021-02-06</d><h>13:28</h><r>jumar</r>The docs say it:
<pre>(defn wrap-anti-forgery
  &quot;Middleware that prevents CSRF attacks. Any POST request to the handler
  returned by this function must contain a valid anti-forgery token, or else an
  access-denied response is returned.

  The anti-forgery token can be placed into a HTML page via the
  *anti-forgery-token* var, which is bound to a random key unique to the
  current session. By default, the token is expected to be in a form field
  named &apos;__anti-forgery-token&apos;, or in the &apos;X-CSRF-Token&apos; or &apos;X-XSRF-Token&apos;
  headers.</pre>
That is the <code>*anti-forgerky-token*</code> var should be set by ring and you should use the var to pass the value to the http response, save it on client and then pass it back to the server when you&apos;re doing the POST request.

E.g. we use Selmer so we pass this as a html template param:
<pre>:csrf-token *anti-forgery-token*</pre>
This is used by javascript functions like this:
<pre>&lt;script&gt;
  (() =&gt; {
    abc.init({
...
      csrfToken: &apos;{{csrf-token}}&apos;
    });</pre>
and we also use the convenient <code>anti-forgery-field</code> function and add the csrf token automatically to all html templates
<pre>(selmer.parser/add-tag! :csrf-field (fn [_ _] (anti-forgery-field)))</pre>

We&apos;re using it with ring-jetty-adapter , and are starting the server with :async? true , so all our handlers have arity [request response raise] , where response and raise are functions. We&apos;re doing this because some of our requests can be quite long-running, and we need to make a blocking I/O call to get the response data. The thing is, Jetty JMX metrics are showing us that a long-running request is still holding onto one of the threads from Jetty&apos;s threadpool while in progress, so during a load test we hit in-progress requests = threadpool max, the thread queue size spikes, and we see healthcheck requests start timing out (we think due to being stuck in the queue), even though they have no blocking calls etc to slow things down. I thought the whole point of async here was that that didn&apos;t happen. I&apos;ve found various overly-simplistic examples detailing Jetty async (e.g. https://www.baeldung.com/jetty-embedded and https://webtide.com/servlet-3-1-async-io-and-jetty/ ), which show setting up a WriteListener with onWritePossible method, but they just use &apos;content&apos; to write as a string buffer or similar, not a blocking I/O call like we have. I can&apos;t find any equivalent to that within ring .

Are we supposed to be doing work within our handler to create a future and build the response within it, then servlet/update-servlet-response will make sure that is correctly matched up with the request?

I am using the ring session middleware to implement sessions. I had the :cookie-attrs set to {:max-age cookie-expiry-time} which was ok but now browsers are changing their behavoir. And I recently got the warning in firefox: Cookie “myCookie” will be soon rejected because it has the “SameSite” attribute set to “None” or an invalid value, without the “secure” attribute. To know more about the “SameSite” attribute, read . So i need to upgrade my cookies to be secure. So I set :cookie-attrs to {:max-age cookie-expiry-time :secure true} , and this does set the Secure flag on the sent cookie.

I had the :cookie-attrs set to  <code>{:max-age cookie-expiry-time}</code> which was ok but now browsers are changing their behavoir. And I recently got the warning in firefox: <code>Cookie “myCookie” will be soon rejected because it has the “SameSite” attribute set to “None” or an invalid value, without the “secure” attribute. To know more about the “SameSite” attribute, read </code>. So i need to upgrade my cookies to be secure. So I set :cookie-attrs to <code>{:max-age cookie-expiry-time :secure true}</code>, and this does set the Secure flag on the sent cookie. However, clients with existing cookies with Secure=false do not get a new upgraded cookie sent to them. If the cookie is sent from the client ring adopts it and uses it for the session id. I need it to send a new upgraded cookie setting in the response if the client sent cookie does not match the one that would be sent (like doesnt have secure set).

If it threw the exception I could wrap the client request in a try/catch block and be done with it.</z><z id="t1695878580" t="seancorfield bad-request returns a 400 status, not a 200 status."><y>#</y><d>2023-09-28</d><h>05:23</h><r>seancorfield</r><code>bad-request</code> returns a 400 status, not a 200 status.</z><z id="t1695878591" t="seancorfield You must have something else messing with the response."><y>#</y><d>2023-09-28</d><h>05:23</h><r>seancorfield</r>You must have something else messing with the response.</z><z id="t1695878646" t="seancorfield (I know this works -- we return 4xx status a lot in our app at work)"><y>#</y><d>2023-09-28</d><h>05:24</h><r>seancorfield</r>(I know this works -- we return 4xx status a lot in our app at work)</z><z id="t1695878752" t="Saket Patel I believe we are talking about two different places when we talk about status.

I&apos;m looking to integrate the new websockets protocols into an adapter that we maintain, and I have several questions:
• Why are -send and -send-async separate methods? Couldn&apos;t they be a single multi-arity method? In case an adapter does not support it, you can always throw a &quot;not implemented&quot; exception.

Thanks :D</z><z id="t1699972807" t="weavejester -send and -send-async are separate methods so they can be in separate protocols. This allows you to check using satisfies? whether or not a socket supports async behaviour, without relying on catching an exception. There is not a -ping-async and -pong-async because this wasn&apos;t supported by the Jakarta Servlet websocket implementation. So we can&apos;t assume that if an underlying websocket library supports async messages, that it also supports async ping/pong. However, I could add a new AsyncPingPongSocket protocol to support it."><y>#</y><d>2023-11-14</d><h>14:40</h><r>weavejester</r><code>-send</code> and <code>-send-async</code> are separate methods so they can be in separate protocols.
