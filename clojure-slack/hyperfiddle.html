* Click on date to keep day visible regardless of filter.

I have a few pages of notes of ideas I&apos;ve had in the past for tools for making faster prototypes - e.g. where the web layout could be defined based on metadata in the schema (DatSys also does this, but it&apos;s got a long ways to go imo), or where prototype development should be a similar level of simplicity to designing an Excel spreadsheet to solve your need - but these were all just ideas, so I&apos;m really happy to see someone else has not only noticed similar needs but has already spent a couple years making a great solution to it 😄"><y>#</y><d>2018-08-04</d><h>18:03</h><w>miridius</w>thanks <b>🙂</b> I&apos;m really excited about HyperFiddle so far.

I&apos;ve reading a few different Clojure forums lately, including <a href="https://reddit.com/r/clojure" target="_blank">https://reddit.com/r/clojure</a>, and <a href="https://clojureverse.org/" target="_blank">https://clojureverse.org/</a>. But add on that various Google searches, I can&apos;t say for sure where I first saw hyperfiddle referenced. No problem with waiting, first I should probably finish the Clojure books I&apos;m working on.</z><z id="t1535987995" t="didiercrunch Hi, can I have beta?"><y>#</y><d>2018-09-03</d><h>15:19</h><w>didiercrunch</w>Hi, can I have beta?</z><z id="t1535988125" t="didiercrunch I look forward to play with hyperfiddle.

The problem is if propagation of aa being now 2 reaches cc after dd has run and consumed the prior value of cc, thus coming up with a result inconsistent with aa=2.

fwiw, the way both MobX and Cells work is to detect (by different mechanisms!) that cc is a change generation too old, and recomputes cc before responding to the read. Cells uses a serially increasing &quot;pulse&quot;, and tbh I forget what MobX does to determine obsolescence.</z><z id="t1652372100" t="kennytilton I meant to ask how to increment aa. 🙂"><y>#</y><d>2022-05-12</d><h>16:15</h><w>kennytilton</w>I meant to ask how to increment aa. <b>🙂</b></z><z id="t1652372321" t="kennytilton Ah, vanilla swap!. 🙂 Looks promising -- I had added a print to the dd computation and it ran only once."><y>#</y><d>2022-05-12</d><h>16:18</h><w>kennytilton</w>Ah, vanilla swap!. <b>🙂</b> Looks promising --  I had added a print to the dd computation and it ran only once.</z><z id="t1652372547" t="Dustin Getz rcf/! is basically println, it is the &quot;test probe&quot; that captures when it was called so that the order of &quot;test probe effects&quot; can be asserted with %"><y>#</y><d>2022-05-12</d><h>16:22</h><w>Dustin Getz</w>rcf/! is basically println, it is the &quot;test probe&quot; that captures when it was called so that the order of &quot;test probe effects&quot; can be asserted with %</z><z id="t1652373556" t="kennytilton So all looks good.

Operators with continuous time semantics like combineLatest are necessarily glitchy, we all agree glitches are bad and stalz-refactoring is not an acceptable solution, no argument here. The problem is essential to the GoF observer pattern, clojure watch mechanism has the exact same problem. • Matrix cells are a continuous time abstraction. The engine is able to maintain a DAG of cells with dynamic topology, and propagate a change through it without glitches. Discrete time events are not managed, so all effects interacting with the engine must be written imperative style, with callbacks and direct mutation of reference objects. • Missionary aims to support both discrete and continuous time, to combine the benefits of managed effects AND glitch-free propagation. The flow abstraction supports both semantics and you can switch from one to the other with functional composition. This approach scales extremely well, you can go a very long way without having to ever mutate a single reference. Photon inherits this property. [:attrs {:href &quot;/_/_/users/U0PUGPSFR&quot;}] The purpose of watch is purely interop. It is provided as a convenience for setting up a simple communication channel, to write unit tests or experiment at the REPL. Atoms and watches are sparingly used in a real application.

How do I configure it to only be included in the server side?</z><z id="t1653677440" t="nottmey Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; Syntax error macroexpanding at (closure.clj:77:5). at

BTW Even though the demo clearly makes the technical point, I feel like it would be more convincing if... each item showed more of its (full)path! It&apos;s a small detail, but the results feel incomplete, less valuable because of the contextual omission, and it seems to potentially and uselessly cast a shadow on the overall.

Another detail, likewise, would be the suggestion to replace the scrollbar with typical label-links for each page number. Again, not required to technically prove HF...

All stuff that some of us users could contribute.

My mental model of a web app is I open a page, I fill out my form and I press submit

Very rarely I might get a history button of some kind to restore changes

So I think it’s not connecting because it looks unfamiliar so I’m left asking “why would I need this?” Because it’s not packaged in a way that is familiar to me

I’m also personally kind of interested in what happens if two people are staging two different change sets on the same data (in a way that conflicts), what happens to the last person’s set of changes once the first person commits</z><z id="t1662896956" t="Lidor Cohen Hi, is there anyway to access to original dom/on-change"><y>#</y><d>2022-09-11</d><h>11:49</h><w>Lidor Cohen</w>Hi, is there anyway to access to original <code>dom/on-change</code></z><z id="t1662898305" t="Dustin Getz are you trying to get an old example working? paste here and i will upgrade it"><y>#</y><d>2022-09-11</d><h>12:11</h><r>Dustin Getz</r>are you trying to get an old example working? paste here and i will upgrade it</z><z id="t1662901774" t="Lidor Cohen actually, I&apos;m trying to fix the todo-mvc demo (the toggle-all feature, specifically): (let [active (p/server (todo-count db :active)) all (p/server (todo-count db :all)) done (p/server (todo-count db :done))] (ui/checkbox {::dom/class &quot;toggle-all&quot; ::dom/on-change print ::ui/value (zero? active) ::ui/input-event (p/fn [e] (let [any-actives?

We&apos;ll be evaluating the adaption of photon over the next few months. Most applications currently target node for the backend, hence the question. We&apos;re just exploring options for now.
