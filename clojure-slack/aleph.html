I am building a full stack Clojure(Script) application from a re-natal template. I added Datomic and various libraries to also have a website, frontend and backend.
I use integrant for the system and... aleph for the webserver.
I stumbled on a weird behaviour : sometimes, after a cider refresh, all HTTP requests hang forever. The only solution I found is to stop everything and cider-jack-in again.
Switching to http-kit seems to solve the problem.
On other lightest projects (mainly without the re-natal stack) I have no problems.
Did anyone experience that?

i was studying that example earlier, but it&apos;s a bit hard to follow without navigating around the source with some proper clojure editor.

for example both the <code>ring/router</code> and the <code>ring/ring-handler</code> accept options, but extra middlewares i supply to the <code>ring/ring-handler</code>, but the example only shows interceptors within a <code>{:data {:interceptors ...}}</code> structure of the <code>http/routes</code> function

the indentation is not deep enough to immediately see which option block belongs to which function.

Aleph’s set up to completely manage connections behind the scenes for you. In theory, you could call aleph.http.client/close-connection on the stored connection in the default-connection-pool, but I couldn’t get that to work off the top of my head, since the underlying Dirigiste object pool is kind of opaque. You could use intermediate functions to directly get a conn, like copying and calling create-connection , but there’s a lot of intermediate code that would be bypassed that’s necessary to correct functioning.

You have a few issues going on at once, but the main one is buffering pauses because it’s not needed. First, d/loop . This behavior seems expected to me. The only effect buffering should have here is to allow the websocket stream to accumulate some data before you start take! ing. If you open the ws and subscribe, but don’t do any take! s, the buffer will fill up. When you start the d/loop , it will print out all the buffered values very fast, and then slow down to the actual rate of incoming messages. The buffer is empty because it doesn’t need to buffer; messages are processed faster than they come in. Check the v values, they’re sequential, so no trades are being missed (Though, if you wait too long to start taking, the buffer may fill up, and messages will be missed then, but that’s not a bug). Otherwise d/loop seems to work for me. It goes into an infinite loop of printing trades as they come. I’m not seeing any disconnections. There might be something rate- or load-sensitive that I’m not seeing from my timezone. Another possibility to consider is network flakiness. The Bybits docs say that to prevent network timeouts, you should https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/spot/#t-heartbeat . See the heartbeats config option in Aleph for more on that (or send them in your own separate thread if you like). Second, consume-async . Your code has a bug. The anonymous fn literal #() has a few limitations, one of which is that it has to be a single valid form. You have to wrap in a do like you do inside the d/loop . Better still, switch to fn , #() is meant to be for short one-liners. Once I wrapped it in a do , consumer-async also works as expected, an inifinte loop of messages. Given the message sizes, I don’t think increasing the max frame parameters should have an effect here. I checked this with both 0.4.6 and the latest 0.5.0-rc2, same behavior in both cases."><y>#</y><d>2022-07-07</d><h>07:41</h><w>Matthew Davidson (kingmob)</w>Hi <a>@pereira.cj</a>.

First, <code>d/loop</code>. This behavior seems expected to me.

So i am doing a very naughty thing. I am creating a middleman between frontend and actual backend.
I don&apos;t want to change frontend and i don&apos;t want to change backend (that&apos;s a requirement)
I want middleman to to connect to backend and wire messages to the frontend.

I am using postman to simulate frontend client)

The reason why i ask asking about client disconnects is because if i don&apos;t the connections atom will only grow because when i &apos;disconnect&apos; using postman the middleman (code above) doesn&apos;t react. Messages from backend continue coming (and being logged as seen in <code>on-msg</code>

Roughly speaking, Clojure seqs and http://java.io .Input/OutputStreams are pull-based, while Manifold is push-based. Manifold tries to automatically send things downstream, and stops when it can’t push (backpressure); in contrast, seqs/java.io.*Streams do nothing until you tell them to write or read data for you. It’s easy to make a pull-based source work in Manifold: stream take!s become derefs or .read()s of the underlying source as needed. Likewise for turning a Manifold stream into a seq/j.io.*Stream: backpressure forces manifold to slow down to the rate of seq/j.io.InputStream consumption (e.g., see manifold.stream/stream-&gt;seq ). Sinks are a bit harder. Since Manifold is designed to automatically push values downstream as they appear, to turn that into a pull-based sink requires ferrying code to call .write()s, and potentially a buffer in-between (potentially unbounded) or a timeout. I don’t know Zach’s original rationale, but my guess is that the policy to go from a Manifold stream to an OutputStream might vary between users, so he didn’t want to prescribe what to do. E.g., yoke them, use a buffer, write to a temp file, drop excess mesgs, use background threads or not, etc? Or, it could be he just built it for his own purposes, which seems mostly about getting bytes in, not out. ¯\(ツ)/¯ Your solution to yoke the two together seems fine, btw (although Thread/yield seems sus). Since it only take!s as fast as it .write()s, backpressure forces the stream to slow down to the speed of the OutputStream, so that should be ok."><y>#</y><d>2022-08-02</d><h>14:44</h><r>Matthew Davidson (kingmob)</r><a>@U4FFD43T4</a> OK, I’m a bit sleep-deprived, but my take is the discrepancy you’re seeing may be due to the difference in pull vs push stream semantics.

On the other hand, we’re concerned about the impact of switching to returning nil. Would this change heavily affect you? React with an emoji to answer.

So I wonder if there is an easy way to enable the compression or I need to do it manually, and if the latter, what is the best way to do it.

Due to the large install base (Aleph 0.4.6 was downloaded a million times), changing the mvn group could mean a lot of users won&apos;t find it.

I discovered the Netty documentation and... it&apos;s kind of hard to get used to. It is the first time I go this deep into a Java lib and it&apos;s not the same as using ClojureDocs and reading Clojure source code.
<a>@UFKCFTVB8</a> when I aggregate the ByteBuf returned by by the :raw-stream? TCP connection (which returns a <code>PooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf</code>) I randomly get an <code>IllegalReferenceCountException</code>  with info about a .release method not called before GC and a risk of memory leaks. This error seems to come when the ByteBufs are kept too long in the <code>compositeBuffer</code>.
The code of the application should be open-sourced once finished. I&apos;ll post the link here when it&apos;s done.

I am using aleph to handle SSE on the server side and I am not sure that the approach I have used is ideal, so I am looking for help.

The code is structured like this:
• For each &quot;room&quot; I create a source stream and put it in atom hashmap (key room id, value the stream)
• For each user connecting to a room I get the source stream, create a sink stream and connect it to the source
    ◦ and return the sink stream in the response of the SSE endpoint so that I can send events to users
• When I need to broadcast messages I send them to the source stream which then forwards to the users
• Once user disconnects, their sink stream is marked as drained, so periodically I look at all the source stream and, using s/downstream to get all connected stream, if all downstreams are drained I close the source stream and remove it from the atom
Questions:
• are there better ways to broadcast messages to users in a room?
• is there a better way to handle user disconnecting and cleanup an empty room? Is the current approach leaking resources?
• I was thinking about using an event-bus with a topic for each room and user subscriptions to that topic? How does it scale? Does it automatically cleanup disconnected users?

Thanks for the additional feedback.

Regarding the terminology, yes, I am a bit confused <b>😅</b>
My assumptions are (were?):
• the room stream is both a sink (it receives events to be broadcasted) and a source (send events to user streams), but the main &quot;role&quot; here is to broadcast so I have called it the <code>source</code>
• user streams, <code>s/connect</code>ed to room streams are again sinks (receive events from the room) and sources (send SSE data to the browser), and for simplicity I&apos;ve called them sources
Probably I have oversimplified and I need to adjust my understanding of the terminology, thanks for the feedback! <b>🙏</b>

&gt; So, when you say the user&apos;s sink stream is drained, do you mean the user has read all the messages they&apos;ll get?
This is what I have observed:
• I have created a room and connected a user to it, using <code>s/downstream</code> on the room&apos;s stream I get the user&apos;s stream which, inspected, shows these properties 
<pre>Class: manifold.stream.default.Stream
Value: &quot;&lt;&lt; stream: {:pending-puts 0, :drained? false, :buffer-size 0, :permanent? false, :type \&quot;manifold\&quot;, :sink? true, :closed? false, :pending-takes 1...

--- Fields:
  &quot;__closedCallbacks&quot; = (  )
  &quot;__drainedCallbacks&quot; = (  )
  &quot;__isClosed&quot; = false
  &quot;__isDrained&quot; = false</pre>
• closing the web page, the user&apos;s stream is still connected to the room stream and looks like this 
<pre>Class: manifold.stream.default.Stream
Value: &quot;&lt;&lt; stream: {:pending-puts 0, :drained? true, :buffer-size 0, :permanent? false, :type \&quot;manifold\&quot;, :sink? true, :closed? true, :pending-takes 0, ...

--- Fields:
  &quot;__closedCallbacks&quot; = (  )
  &quot;__drainedCallbacks&quot; = (  )
  &quot;__isClosed&quot; = true
  &quot;__isDrained&quot; = true</pre>
Before I didn&apos;t notice that it was both drained and closed, and based on your comment I should use <code>s/closed?</code> instead of <code>s/drained?</code>to understand if all users have closed their page/connection, is that correct? (the room stream is still not closed or drained at this point so I should look at all downstream streams)

I understand that the room&apos;s stream should be closed automatically at some point when there are no active downstream but the point is that events are generated after user action so if there are no users generating events then there will not be new <code>put</code>s which would mark the upstream as closed, so it looks like that the manual cleaning process is still needed.

&gt; Your use case is a pub/sub architecture, and is exactly what <code>event-bus</code> was built for
I&apos;ve learned about <code>event-bus</code> only recently and I want to give it a try but I have a couple of concerns:
• how does it scale? should I have a bus for each room or one for the whole system with a topic per room?
• how does cleaning works with the <code>event-bus</code>? should I expect it to automatically remove subscriptions on user disconnections? Should I manage <code>event-bus</code> instances like I do for the stream approach?

It’s not much to look at: (aleph-http/post endpoint {:body (json/write-str (assoc default-parameters :stream true)) :headers {&quot;Content-Type&quot; &quot;application/json&quot; &quot;Authorization&quot; (str &quot;Bearer &quot; (api-key))}}) :stream true tells the endpoint to stream back responses rather than send a single chunk, which is something I’d like to make use of as I can then stream them to the user. Being that it returns a deferred, I get the responses batched at the end of the request, however. So it’d be great to be able to consume the response stream as it happens. I’ve mucked around with (aleph-http/post endpoint {:pool (aleph-http/connection-pool {:connection-options {:raw-stream? true}}) :body (json/write-str (assoc default-parameters :stream true)) :headers {&quot;Content-Type&quot; &quot;application/json&quot; &quot;Authorization&quot; (str &quot;Bearer &quot; (api-key))}}) But I don’t really know what I’m doing here."><y>#</y><d>2023-01-27</d><h>08:03</h><r>henrik</r>Hi <a>@UFKCFTVB8</a>!

This is where content-length and chunked transfer encoding comes in.

Admittedly, it gets more convoluted once we add HTTP pipelining, which enables a requestor to send multiple requests before getting a response. This is where content-length and chunked transfer encoding comes in.

On the server-side, if you use HTTP/1.1 pipelining, and a later handler finishes before an earlier one, it will be chained to wait until the previous one&apos;s deferred is finished, so there&apos;s no issues there.</z><z id="t1676917635" t="Matthew Davidson (kingmob) What evidence do we currently have that this is related to dirigiste?

Unfortunately, Netty (which Aleph is built on), doesn&apos;t have any support for multipart in their HTTP2 code.

After a little back and forth, I asked one of the RFC authors for clarification, he put it to the HTTP working group, and...there doesn&apos;t seem to be agreement among the experts, unfortunately. Since Aleph&apos;s not wedded to an implementation yet, do users have a preference for HTTP errors? Specifically, if it&apos;s possible, would you prefer HTTP 4xx/5xx responses (when possible) or &quot;reset stream&quot;/&quot;go away&quot; errors?

I&apos;m trialling h2spec to validate Aleph&apos;s H2 server behavior, and on one of h2spec&apos;s issues, I responded with a disagreement about an interpretation of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html" target="_blank">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html</a>. After a little back and forth, I asked one of the RFC authors for clarification, he put it to the HTTP working group, and...there doesn&apos;t seem to be agreement among the experts, unfortunately.

Since Aleph&apos;s not wedded to an implementation yet, do users have a preference for HTTP errors? Specifically, if it&apos;s possible, would you prefer HTTP 4xx/5xx responses (when possible) or &quot;reset stream&quot;/&quot;go away&quot; errors? The HTTP 4xx/5xx responses have the advantage of being able to provide a specific error message in the body. The &quot;reset stream&quot;/&quot;go away&quot; frames are handled via exception mechanisms (since the client will probably never get an HTTP response after getting RST_STREAM/GOAWAY), so you will get instant feedback that something went wrong.

Anyway, Aleph isn&apos;t currently affected, and I&apos;ll make sure the new H2 code uses the fixed Netty version</z><z id="t1697190160" t="dergutemoritz [:attrs {:href &quot;/_/_/users/U10EC98F5&quot;}] Not all of them - haproxy was immune already 😄"><y>#</y><d>2023-10-13</d><h>09:42</h><r>dergutemoritz</r><a>@U10EC98F5</a> Not all of them - haproxy was immune already <b>😄</b></z><z id="t1697190223" t="Matthew Davidson (kingmob) heh"><y>#</y><d>2023-10-13</d><h>09:43</h><r>Matthew Davidson (kingmob)</r>heh</z><z id="t1697190234" t="dergutemoritz stops picking the nits"><y>#</y><d>2023-10-13</d><h>09:43</h><r>dergutemoritz</r>stops picking the nits</z><z id="t1697203660" t="dergutemoritz [:attrs {:href &quot;/_/_/users/UGNFXV1FA&quot;}] I just got a notification about this comment: https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/5912#issuecomment-1761508540"><y>#</y><d>2023-10-13</d><h>13:27</h><r>dergutemoritz</r><a>@UGNFXV1FA</a> I just got a notification about this comment: <a href="https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/5912#issuecomment-1761508540" target="_blank">https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/5912#issuecomment-1761508540</a></z><z id="t1697203735" t="dergutemoritz IIUIC NVD accidentally considers 4.1.100 a fix version for that CVE, too?

First, this issue is meant to be exploratory. We need a short report first, before any code. My biggest concern is that it won&apos;t be that useful.

Unfortunately, we have limited resources, and supporting modern codecs without requiring the deps started consuming more effort than I&apos;d like, and I&apos;m concerned about future maintenance burden. I originally designed it all to keep the codec deps optional, but that&apos;s trickier than it looks, it turns out. At its root, the issue is the Clojure language uses the same syntax for static member access and static function calls, and the compiler requires reflection to distinguish between the two.

I ended up writing a whole Java class just to provide a Clojure-safe facade for the problem. Despite that, the problem cropped up again in a new form. While I think I can still make the codecs optional, both choices started to seem equal overall, so I thought it worth asking the users if they had a preference. Other consequences: for Brotli, it&apos;s effectively https://caniuse.com/brotli , and I have no problem making it a default, and if optional, fewer people would enable it. Zstd&apos;s future is less clear, but including the Brotli deps and not the Zstd one would just be the worst of both worlds.

This short-circuits invocations on all later handlers in the chain, and is usually a good idea for efficiency. Aleph wraps the user handler with its own netty-compatible handler, which takes your Ring response, adds the Server header (among others), and in 0.4.x, starts writing Http* objects.

My suggestion is to insert a netty/channel-outbound-handler and set the :write so that if it gets an HttpMessage , it alters the .headers , and passes it along.
