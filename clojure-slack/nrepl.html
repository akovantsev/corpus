As a result of this issue, the cider repl is stuck at the <code>user =&gt;</code> prompt (clojure/java repl if I understand correctly) and never reaches the <code>cljs.user =&gt;</code> repl.
Strangest thing, when I was troubleshooting this issue, I made a copy of the project in another directory.
By mistake, while the app was running on the simulator from the second copy of the project,  I jacked in with cider from the first copy, and I got a half working <code>cljs.user =&gt;</code> repl (I could execute code  in the running application, but <code>cljs.pprint.pprint</code> was undefined so I was getting errors in the cider repl).

Here are my system details:
Os: Arch linux
Emacs: recent version compiled from sources (master). native comp enabled

I have a clojure project that I am running in a docker container, and I have logging (using logback) enabled for the project.

When I run the application entirely locally (no docker) via a normal repl the console logs appear as expected in the repl when I run tests and so on. So it appears to be a problem with my nrepl config.

Here’s a minimal reproduction:
<pre>;; src/cljs/user.cljs
(ns cljs.user
  (:require [weasel.repl :as repl]))

;; build.clj (running compiler)
(cljs.build.api/build 
 {:output-dir    &quot;.compiled/cljs&quot;,
  :output-to     &quot;.compiled/cljs/prebundle.js&quot;,
  :asset-path    &quot;cljs&quot;,
  :main          &quot;cljs.user&quot;,
  :install-deps  true,
  :optimizations :simple,
  :target        :bundle
  :bundle-cmd    {:default [&quot;esbuild&quot;
                            &quot;.compiled/cljs/prebundle.js&quot;
                            &quot;--bundle&quot;
                            &quot;--outfile=public/js/bundle.js&quot;]}
  :npm-deps
  {&quot;react&quot; &quot;17.0.2&quot;, &quot;react-dom&quot; &quot;17.0.2&quot;, &quot;@react-spring/web&quot; &quot;9.4.2&quot;}}) </pre>
I’ll post the full error from the Clojure process in the thread below.

I realize weasel isn’t very actively maintained, but if anyone can give me a tip on how to go about debugging this, then I’d love to contribute the fix upstream. I’m working on some new ClojureScript tooling that I think weasel would be a great fit for.</z><z id="t1645838594" t="neilyio Full error from the build call above: Feb 25, 2022 5:17:37 PM com.google.javascript.jscomp.LoggerErrorManager println WARNING: .compiled/cljs/inferred_externs.js:13:0: WARNING - [JSC_UNDEFINED_EXTERN_VAR_ERROR ] name goog is not defined in the externs. 13| goog.dependencies_;

Here is what I have been practicing recently (in both CIDER and Calva): listening to user code evaluations through nREPL middleware, and sending the relevant values to Portal.

Currently, some setup is needed (e.g., in the <code>deps.edn</code> file and the Emacs config).
